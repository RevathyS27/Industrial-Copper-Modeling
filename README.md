This project aims to build two machine learning models for the copper sector that will handle the difficulties of predicting selling price and lead classification. Manual predictions are time-consuming and may not result in appropriate price selections or reliable lead capture. The models will use advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in the wrong format, identifying feature distribution, and leveraging tree-based models, specifically the decision tree algorithm, to accurately predict selling price and leads.
